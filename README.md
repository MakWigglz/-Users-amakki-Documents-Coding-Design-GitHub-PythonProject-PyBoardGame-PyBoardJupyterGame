Certainly! To help you refactor your `game.py` and provide code for `queries.py`, `board.py`, `dice.py`, and `token.py`, I’ll provide some example implementations based on common functionality that might be found in a board game application. 

### Refactoring `game.py`

Assuming your `game.py` contains the main game logic, you might want to extract certain functionalities into separate functions or classes to make it cleaner and more maintainable. Here’s a simplified example of what `game.py` might look like after refactoring:

```python
# game/game.py

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.players = []
        self.board = None

    def add_player(self, player):
        self.players.append(player)

    def start_game(self):
        self.initialize_board()
        # Additional game initialization logic

    def initialize_board(self):
        self.board = Board()

    def play_turn(self, player):
        # Logic for a player to take their turn
        pass

    def check_winner(self):
        # Logic to check if there's a winner
        pass
```

### Example Implementations for Other Files

#### `queries.py`

This file can handle database queries. Here’s a simple example:

```python
# database/queries.py

import sqlite3

def get_all_paragraphs(db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM paragraphs")
    paragraphs = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return paragraphs

def add_paragraph(db_path, paragraph):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO paragraphs (text) VALUES (?)", (paragraph,))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

#### `board.py`

This file could represent the game board:

```python
# game/board.py

class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spaces = self.create_spaces()

    def create_spaces(self):
        # Create spaces on the board
        return ["Start", "Space 1", "Space 2", "Space 3", "Finish"]

    def display(self):
        # Logic to display the board
        print("Board Spaces:", self.spaces)
```

#### `dice.py`

This file could handle dice rolling:

```python
# game/dice.py
import random

class Dice:
    def roll(self):
        return random.randint(1, 6)
```

#### `token.py`

This file could represent player tokens:

```python
# game/token.py

class Token:
    def __init__(self, player_name):
        self.player_name = player_name
        self.position = 0

    def move(self, steps):
        self.position += steps
```

### Summary

- **`game.py`**: Refactored to define a `Game` class managing players and game logic.
- **`queries.py`**: Contains functions for database interactions.
- **`board.py`**: Defines a `Board` class to manage board spaces.
- **`dice.py`**: Contains a `Dice` class for rolling dice.
- **`token.py`**: Defines a `Token` class for player tokens.

These examples are basic and can be expanded based on the specific rules and requirements of your board game. Feel free to modify them or let me know if you have specific functionalities in mind that you'd like to implement!
