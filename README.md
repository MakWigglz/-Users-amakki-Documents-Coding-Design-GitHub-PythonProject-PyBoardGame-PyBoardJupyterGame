This layout aids in logical separation and can simplify dependency management as your project evolves. Tools such as virtual environments, logging libraries, and even automation with task runners (like `invoke` or Makefiles) can further ensure your app’s behavior aligns with your design. This structure not only makes maintaining the app easier but also streamlines the process of unit testing and integration testing, ensuring that every part of your application works exactly as planned.
